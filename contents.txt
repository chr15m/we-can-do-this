 001 Life without risk is not living.

 002 When you don't know what to do, think of the person you most respect and imagine what they would do in the same situation.

 004 People trust people who are honest. Be honest.

 005 Be skeptical but not cynical.

 * Inside every respected person is a confidence trickster. Be a confidence trickster. Act like the person you want to be.

 * The only question you ever really need is to ask "why?" again and again. This is a minimal form of Socratic questioning. You are pretty good at this already, kid.

 * "I am wrong," are the finest words in any language. Realize them often and update your mental model based on new evidence.

 * Probably 99% of people on the planet want the same thing - peace, prosperity, and a continuation of their line. Most people are basically alright (but some few people will screw you over for pennies).

 * When you get stuck, talk to people. Seek the advice of those who love you - your family and friends.

 * Manufacture your own luck by chasing opportunities.

 * What goes on in the world is filtered by your mind. If you feel positive, the whole world will seem positive, and visa versa.

 * People will try to convince you of a universal right and wrong. They don't understand the world. Right and wrong vary according to context.

 * Powernaps!

 * Don't lend money to a friend or family member - give away what you can afford, or "lend" without expecting repayment. Financial inequality can ruin a relationship.

 092 If you are unsure, stay unsure and collect more data. Being unsure is fine.

 * Be emotional about the now, rational about the future.

 099 Forget everything above and just practice critical thinking and unconditional love.

 100 Have fun!
